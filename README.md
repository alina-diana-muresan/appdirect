# Twitter streaming app: Typescript + React.js + Backbone.js

A small application built with Typescript, React.js and Backbone.js. Creates streams of twitter data based on a given list of users. Retrieves the last 30 tweets for each, then parses the tweet content, adding links where needed.

Allows for configuring the list of users, as well as the number of tweets to retrieve. Saves the configuration to local storage.
